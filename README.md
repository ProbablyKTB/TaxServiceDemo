# TaxServiceDemo

This is just a simple TaxService implementation. I took the time to add in a few quality of life features:

- Api profiles are managed in configuration files.
- There are additional calculators other than TaxJar to demo potential implementations. 
- The test project has 3 test classes to denote which part of the integration they're testing.
- The site is being publicly hosted at https://taxservicedemokenbarrett.azurewebsites.net/
- I've created a Postman collection of requests you can play around with to additionally test the service.

Note that though there is a lot of defensive coding, there is a severe lack of clean error handling which I normally like to include in my work with more time.

As always, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.
